    <p>A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor.  

        Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular. In India, vegetarian burgers are created using potato and mint instead of a meat patty. 
        
        Regardless of its content, a burger should always be properly cooked to be safe. Rare burgers carry the risk of bacterial infection and food poisoning.</p>
